<h1>Lightning McQueen</h1>

<p>
    A fictional character that inspires me is Lightning McQueen. Lighting McQueen made his  debut in 2006
    where he is the red race car protagonist in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/">Cars</a> (2006).
    Lightning Mcqueen embodies the idea of speed and determination as he tries to make his shot as a rookie.
